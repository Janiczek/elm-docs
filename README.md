# elm-docs

## Organization

Inspired by [this blogpost](https://www.divio.com/blog/documentation/), this documentation is organized into four parts:

1. **Tutorials** (learning-oriented, getting started, lesson-like)
2. **How-to Guides** (goal-oriented, how to solve specific problem, series of steps)
3. **Explanations** (understanding-oriented, background and context)
4. **Reference** (information-oriented, describes the machinery, accurate and complete)
